  "best_practices": [
    "Plant at onset of rains; use mulching to conserve soil moisture",
    "Stake young trees and protect from livestock",
    "Water deeply but infrequently; prioritize early establishment",
    "Use compost or well-decomposed manure; avoid fresh manure on roots",

  "planting": [
    "Ideal planting at onset of long or short rains depending on region",
    "For high altitudes (1500–2200m), select cold-tolerant species and protect seedlings from frost",
    "Dig wide planting holes (e.g., 60cm x 60cm x 60cm), mix topsoil with compost",
    "Water thoroughly after planting and mulch to reduce evaporation"
